/*
One obvious approach to solve this problem would be to sort the input string and then traverse through the sorted string 
to find the character which is occurring maximum number of times. Let us see if we can improve on this. So we will use a 
technique called ‘Hashing’. In this, when we traverse through the string, we would hash each character into an array of 
ASCII characters.

Input string = “test”
1: Construct character count array from the input string.
  count['e'] = 1
  count['s'] = 1
  count['t'] = 2

2: Return the index of maximum value in count array (returns ‘t’).
Typically, ASCII characters are 256, so we use our Hash array size as 256. But if we know that our input string will have 
characters with value from 0 to 127 only, we can limit Hash array size as 128. Similarly, based on extra info known about 
input string, the Hash array size can be limited to 26.
